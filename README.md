Here are the requirements for building a sample Spring Boot service with CRUD operations:

Project Overview:
1. Technology Stack:
   - Use Spring Boot for building the service.
   - Choose an appropriate database (e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage.

2. Entity Model:
   - Define a simple entity model (e.g., Product) with relevant attributes (e.g., id, name, price, quantity).

3. CRUD Operations:
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the entity.
   - Use Spring Data JPA for data access.

4. RESTful Endpoints:
   - Expose RESTful endpoints for each CRUD operation.
   - Example endpoints:
     - POST /api/products (Create)
     - GET /api/products/{id} (Read)
     - PUT /api/products/{id} (Update)
     - DELETE /api/products/{id} (Delete)

5. Validation:
   - Implement validation for request data.
   - Ensure that required fields are present and have valid formats.

6. Exception Handling:
   - Handle exceptions gracefully with proper error messages and HTTP status codes.
   - Implement a custom exception class if necessary.

7. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):
   - Use Data Transfer Objects to represent input and output for API requests.
   - Convert between entities and DTOs as needed.

8. Service Layer:
   - Create a service layer that encapsulates business logic.
   - Separate concerns between the controller, service, and repository.

9. Swagger Documentation:
   - Integrate Swagger for API documentation.
   - Document the API endpoints, request, and response structures.

10. Testing:
    - Write unit tests for service methods using tools like JUnit and Mockito.
    - Include integration tests for the controllers.

11. Dependency Injection:
    - Utilize Spring's dependency injection for managing components.

12. Security (Optional):
    - Implement basic security measures if required (e.g., authentication, authorization).

13. Logging:
    - Include logging to capture important events and errors.

14. Global Exception Handling:
    - Implement a global exception handler to catch unhandled exceptions.

15. Build and Run:
    - Use Maven or Gradle for building the project.
    - Provide clear instructions for running the service locally.

16. Git Repository:
    - Create a Git repository for version control.
    - Commit regularly and use meaningful commit messages.

17. Code Quality:
    - Follow coding standards and best practices.
    - Consider using tools like SonarQube for code quality analysis.
